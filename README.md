# Wake Word Detection Android App

Welcome to the Custom Wake Word Detection Android App! This project is an Android application that detects custom wake words using a pre-trained model running on the ONNX Runtime. Originally developed in Python, the code has been meticulously translated into Java to seamlessly integrate with Android. In this app I have implemented it to detect (Hey Nugget). 

## Features
* Wake Word Detection: Detects custom wake words using a neural network model.
* ONNX Runtime Integration: Utilizes ONNX Runtime for efficient model inference on mobile devices.
* Real-time Processing: Processes audio input in real-time to detect wake words.
* Customizable: Easily adaptable to different wake words and models.

## Prerequisites
Android Studio (latest version recommended)
Android device or emulator running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or higher

## NOTE:
This repository is the first one to provide complete end to end solution for integrating wake word detection models on Android devices. Enjoy!!! 🚀 Give it a thumbs up 👍
